\chapter{CONCLUSIONS}\label{chap6:conclusions}
In this work the BMB system (\ref{eqn:bmblb}) and (\ref{eqn:bmbrb}) is approximated by Hermite interpolating cubic polynomials with two displacement and two slope degrees of freedom for each beam element. Steady state linear quadratic tracking control was applied by obtaining a linear approximation of the nonlinear lift function, employing control design, and applying the control matrices to the nonlinear system. Two control objectives were analyzed: target tracking and morphing trajectory over time. Both of these approaches resulted in a nonlinear controller for the BMB system. Results indicate that although tools from linear distributed parameter control theory can be successfully applied to this model there are limitations to linear control design, primarily difficulties in obtaining stabilizing solutions to algebraic Ricatti equations.
